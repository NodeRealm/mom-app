# Family Hub Frontend

A minimal React Native application with navigation placeholders for
family hub features. Each button opens a placeholder screen.

```
Home -> Tasks | Meals | Hygiene | Schedule | Period
```

Run locally (requires React Native environment):

```
npm install
npx react-native start
```

Use this as a starting point for full feature development.
