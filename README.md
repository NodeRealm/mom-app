# Mom & Dad Family Hub

This repository contains a minimal proof‑of‑concept for a cross‑platform
"Family Hub" app. The project is split into two folders:

- `backend/` – Node.js/Express server exposing basic REST endpoints for
  tasks, meals, hygiene logs, schedules and period tracking.
- `frontend/` – React Native application with placeholder screens for
  navigating those features.

These stubs are intended as a starting point for the full set of
features outlined in the project goal.
